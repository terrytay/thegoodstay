    "quote": "We are endlessly grateful to have found Yee Sin. Over the course of 10 to 11 months, she patiently and consistently came by about once a month to get to know our dogs, Truffle and Brie - a pair of very anxious and reactive pups. From day one, Yee Sin approached them with bravery, calmness, and compassion. She always told us, 'Ok, let’s try!'. Where others might shy away, she leaned in gently and earned their trust, slowly but surely. It’s safe to say that Yee Sin is one of the only friends our dogs have. They are completely at ease with her - something we never take for granted. She walks, feeds, cleans, and treats them with endless affection, and always updates us throughout the day with thoughtful messages, videos, or pictures. Her sense of responsibility and genuine care shines through in everything she does. Despite her own busy schedule, Yee Sin made time to help us during a difficult personal period, and we cannot thank her enough for being there - not just for the dogs, but for us too. Her love for Truffle and Brie is clear, and the feeling is mutual. If you have dogs with special needs or complex temperaments (or if you have normal dogs) Yee Sin is the person you want by their side. We wholeheartedly recommend her services to anyone looking for someone who truly understands and loves dogs, and as a dog owner herself, she really understands the owner’s needs too!",
